Development version
===================
- redirect() and redirect_to() now accept a keyword argument 'abort' to raise
  an exception to do the redirect.
- Added BaseRoute, a interface for custom routes.
- Nested routes are now possible. Routes have now the methiod ``get_routes``,
  a generator that yields the route itself or all nested routes it may contain.
  As an example, `extras/routes.py` has a ``PrefixRoute`` class that prefixes
  all nested routes with a given path. This is based on an idea from
  `werkzeug.routing`.
- Added ``copy()`` method to routes, to return a new instance of a route with
  the same attributes as the original. This is useful to assemble nested routes.
- Added argument `redirect_to` to Route: routes can now redirect automatically
  using RedirectHandler. These two are equivalent::

      route = Route('/foo', RedirectHandler, {'url': '/bar'})
      route = Route('/foo', redirect_to='/bar')


Version 0.3 - August 05, 2010
=============================
- Routes store the handler, as we had in 0.1. This allows custom routes to
  have nested routes.
- Much improved URL building, now delegated to routes.
- added urlunsplit() helper.


Version 0.2 - August 04, 2010
=============================
- Fixed a bug in Route.match() that would make it return positional arguments
  with wrong order. Dictionary is correctly sorted now.
- Added build_only option for routes: routes that are only used for url_for()
  and never match.


Version 0.1 - August 03, 2010
=============================
- Initial release.
